either continuous function (inf,-inf)
or definite set of points integrated
if we can ref f(x) in low-order poly
'gaussian quadriture'

spline: piecewise combination of low-order polynomials connected smooly together

e^ix = cosx + isinx

x.cumsum()  - function to call integration by vertical rectangles (x slices)
    most basic way to integrate
    
cipy.integrate.trapezoid() -    connects points of integration

next up is polynomials aka scipy.inteegrate.simps()
    more accurate, requires quadratics to go from lines -> curves connecting
    
after poly: easier to shrink your dx*dy boxes, than add powers
    
    

N=logspace(0,5,100) n^0 -> n^5 with 100 points between
