Write a script to plot the period of a plane pendulum as a function of amplitude 
from 0 to Ï€. Include a line showing the approximate solution for comparison.
 At what amplitude does the exact solution differ from the approximate solution by 1%?


dblquad_demo.py
This script computes the total mass of the plate described on the Numerical 
Integration webpage.
